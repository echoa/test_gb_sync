# License Overview

All SEA-LION releases embrace an open-source ethos; however, the exact licensing terms may vary depending on the underlying base model’s restrictions or requirements. For instance, if the model leverages Meta’s Llama codebase, it may be bound by the Llama License, which places certain restrictions on commercial use. Similarly, the Gemma2-based variants may carry different terms.

Users should always refer to the Hugging Face model card of each specific SEA-LION model for the most accurate, up-to-date license information.
