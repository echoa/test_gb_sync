# Collaborating with AI Singapore

Launched in May 2017, AI Singapore is a national R&D programme in AI â€“ the very first of its kind on a national level.

AI Singapore welcomes collaborations to further enhance and expand the capabilities of SEA-LION. We offer various partnership modalities to suit different needs and interests, with a focus on open-sourcing results to benefit the wider community. For collaborations other than a self-serve model, an NDA/MOU/CA may have to be signed by both parties.

### 1. Self-Service Model Usage

_Using our model (self-service)_

SEA-LION models are open-source so do feel free to download them for your own needs. If SEA-LION manages to be helpful to you/your team, we would be very grateful if you could let us know!

### 2. Joint Model Building

_Building models together, Data contributions_

We can help incorporate your data into upcoming versions of SEA-LION (which will all be open sourced), to provide you and the community with more performant models which can be further fine-tuned for your specific needs.

### 3. Research Partnerships

If there are areas of research topics where you think that AISG and yourself can work together to work on a common research agenda that can further the work of SEA-LION, please feel free to reach out to us as well. We will be open to joint publications arising from these collaborations too.

If you are interested in any form of collaboration, please feel free to reach out to sealion@aisingapore.org
